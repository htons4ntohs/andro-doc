Authentication/Verification.

The first component of our framework is authentication.

* Every game developer who uses our trophy framework, needs to register with us.
* In the process of registration, we generate a key-pair for him,
  i.e. a set of private and public key pair.
* While sending any requests, the game sends us the 
        -- public key (which should be embedded in the game binary ideally), 
        -- a signature, with a seed based on the private key and timestamp (t),
        -- timestamp (t).

* The idea is, four function f(x) makes the following pair complimentary,

        F1(private_key, timestamp) = Sig1
        F2(public_key,  timestamp) = Sig2

        F3(Sig1, Sig2) = 0

* This way we do not maintain any private key, and just have to invest thought
  on generating the keys and making them work with above calculation.

* We also need a custom algorithm for having F1, F2 and F3.
