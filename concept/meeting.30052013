Agenda:
Android Trophies

Discussion:

Like PS3 and XBOX, there is a requirement for a framework to have Android
trophies. The Android trophies project will serve as a baseline for Android
game developers across the world.

The Android trophies will allow, games to award trophies and points to all
the gamers across the world, and they can chart themselves globally with
respect to gamers playing all different kind of games (all using Andtrophies),
globally ! This is will give them their "Gamer-Rank", which will be 
irrespective of the game he/she is playing.

Components.

* Authentication, -- we need to uniquely identify each developer with their
                     private key/public key. This will be a server side
                     authentication, and in the web api the developer will pass
                     his public key, timestamp and signature.

* Backend Web service, -- HTTP/JSON based, request response. Implementation,
                          Node/Javascript, or Python/Django.
                          This will receive requests in our custom API from
                          the android service.

* Android service, -- Will take request from the local app and sync it directly
                      with our servers, running the backend web service.
                      Can perform basic verification, validation.

* Visual App/Widget, -- This will be a "fancy" application on Android and/or
                        a widget, which will display gamer's ranks/points/
                        trophies, and will be served by Android Service.
